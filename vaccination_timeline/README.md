This dataset shows when each vaccine was introduced for humans, for the first time.

### Details

- For each disease, I've tracked down the year when a working vaccine was first available in any country
- For updated versions of each vaccine, I've mostly limited the dataset to vaccines licensed in the US
- I've listed the brand name, inventor/manufacturer, strains included or subtype of vaccine when possible

#### Which new versions of vaccines included?

- All updated vaccines licensed in the US, except:
  - expanded approvals (e.g. the same vaccine approved for a new demographic)
  - updated smallpox vaccines - due to the number of updated smallpox vaccines, I've only included a few major types in the dataset
- Some other important updated vaccines, e.g. the TBE vaccine (from Porton Down)

#### Other notes

- For Covid-19 vaccines, dates refer to EUAs
- For vaccines which were the first for a disease but were later withdrawn, they are labelled with a * in the Name column
