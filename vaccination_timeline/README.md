This dataset shows when each vaccine was introduced for humans, for the first time.

### Details

- For each vaccine, I've tried to track down the year it was first made available, with a citation.
- I've also listed the name of the inventor when they were mentioned incidentally, but several are missing.

#### Which new versions of vaccines included?

The dataset also shows new versions of some vaccines and when they were made available.
This hopefully covers most of them but is likely incomplete, and it was harder to track down the exact years for several historical ones.

- For HPV vaccines, for example, Gardasil and Gardasil-9 are both shown separately.
- For flu vaccines, 'new versions' refers to new platforms (e.g. a live attenuated vaccine vs. a protein vaccine, or a pandemic flu vaccine).
