This folder contains several scripts and charts to show causes of death across age groups, using data from the United States.

The data can be found on the [CDC Wonder's database](https://wonder.cdc.gov/).

Each script below includes code to create charts on the relative share of deaths from each cause, the number of deaths from each cause, and the death rate from each cause. These are shown across age groups.
