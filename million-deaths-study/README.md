This folder contains data and a script to create a chart comparing deaths in homes and hospitals in India's Million Deaths Study.

The data comes from Table 3 in the study: 

Gomes, M., Begum, R., Sati, P., Dikshit, R., Gupta, P. C., Kumar, R., Sheth, J., Habib, A., & Jha, P. (2017). 
Nationwide Mortality Studies To Quantify Causes Of Death: Relevant Lessons From India’s Million Death Study. Health Affairs, 36(11), 1887–1895. https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0635

I've turned this into an xlsx spreadsheet, and sheet 2 contains the data used in the script.
